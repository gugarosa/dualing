Welcome to Dualing's documentation!
====================================

Have you ever wanted to find if there is any similarity between your data? If yes, Dualing is the right package! We implement state-of-the-art dual-based neural networks, such as Siamese Networks, to cope with learning similarity functions between sets of data. Such a strategy helps in providing clearer manifolds and better-embedded data for a wide range of applications.

Use Dualing if you need a library or wish to:

* Create similarity measures;
* Design or use pre-implement state-of-the-art Siamese Networks;
* Mix-and-match a new approach to solve your problem;
* Because it is fun to find resemblances;

Dualing is compatible with: **Python 3.6+**.
